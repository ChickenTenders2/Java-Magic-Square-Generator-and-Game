The first CM1210 (Object Oriented Java Programming) coursework involves two projects. The first is to
create an algorithm to generate a magic square for a given positive odd integer; the second is to create
a command line game that requires the user to solve a shuffled magic square for a given positive odd
integer. My goals for the first project are to create a working magic square generator that first prompts
the user to input a positive odd integer, then generates the magic square of size n * n in a 2D array
format. My goals for the second project are to be able to successfully shuffle a requested magic square
n * n times, allowing the user to reconstruct the shuffled magic square through input, a win condition
that alerts the user that they have won, as well as displaying the number of moves made to achieve the
rearrangement, and finally a prompt on whether the user wants to restart or exit the game. Throughout
this coursework, I aim to improve my knowledge of the Java programming language, familiarizing
myself with the Java reserved keywords and various methods to fully utilize Javaâ€™s capabilities.
